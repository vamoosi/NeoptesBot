# NeoptesBot
Telegram bot using [Telebot](https://github.com/mullwar/telebot) which was maybe a mistake bc I sure got a lot more results for other nodejs telegram bot frameworks when I was googling for help!

trying to figure out how to integrate [neopets image finder](https://github.com/dragonfire535/neopet-image-finder) ... but i'm not smart.
